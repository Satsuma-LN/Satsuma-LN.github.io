            <h2>Why use Bisq</h2>
            <p>
                Bisq is a P2P (peer to peer) decentralised exchange, this means when you buy or sell bitcoin you interact 
                directly with the person on the other side of the trade. The main benefit of this in my mind is privacy:
                you do not need to go through any KYC (know your customer) as you would with centralised exchanges such as 
                coinbase or binance and all of your personal data is stored locally on your own computer. Another plus is 
                security, you always hold your own keys so you are not exposed to

            <h2>How to guid</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Getting Bisq</h3></li>
                <p>
                    First go to <a href="https://bisq.network/downloads/" target=_blank>https://bisq.network/downloads/</a> and
                    download the corresponding files for your computer, this guide was done on a mac so I'll download the .dmg
                    file and the corresponding PGP signature.
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq1.png" class="screenshot"/>
                <p>
                    The next few steps are to ensure that the .dmg file is authentic. Open the terminal app and run (copy and
                    paste the following line into the terminal window and hit enter)
                </p>
                <p class="code">ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</p>
                <p>
                    hit enter, type your password if prompted and wait for homebrew to install.
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq2.png" class="terminal"/>
                <p>
                    If you get the warning message /opt/homebrew/bin is not in your path follow the instructions under 
                    "Next steps". Then run the two lines separately
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq3.png" class="terminal"/>
                <p class="code">brew install gnupg</p>
                <p class="code">curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import</p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq4.png" class="terminal"/>
                <p>
                    The previous command imports the public key of Christoph Attender (ripcurlx). His public key ID is 29CDFD3B
                    and fingerprint is CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75 500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B, which you can verify throough 
                    <a href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/commits?author=ripcurlx" target=_blank>commits on github</a> 
                    and on <a href="https://keybase.io/ripcurlx" target=_blank>keybase</a>, now run 
                </p>
                <p class="code">cd Downloads</p>
                <p class="code">gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify Bisq-1.7.3.dmg.asc</p>
                <p>
                    replacing Bisq-1.7.3.dmg.asc with the file name of the .asc file you downloaded.
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq5.png" class="terminal"/>
                <p>
                    If all is well you should get a message similar to the one above, check that the key fingerprint is correct.
                    Congratulations you have verified that the .dmg file you downloaded is authentic and it is safe to open it,
                    and install Bisq.
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq6.png" class="screenshot"/>
                <p>
                    If you are using a newer m1 mac when you open bisq for the first time you may be prompted to install Rosetta
                    if you have not done so before. If you get a message:"Bisq" can't be opened because it was not downloaded from
                    the App Store, open system preferences and go to security and privacy and hit open anyway. You have now 
                    installed bisq, you can now eject the bisq volume and delete the .dmg and .asc files. 
                </p>

                <li><h3>Getting started with Bisq</h3></li>
                <p>
                    The first time you open Bisq you should be greated by a screen like this
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq10.png" class="screenshot">
                <p>
                    Before you make a trade there are several things you should do:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set a strong password
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq11.png" class="screenshot">
                <p>
                    Write down your wallets seed words, these words give access to any funds in your Bisq wallet so keep it
                    secure
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq12.png" class="screenshot">
                <p>
                    Create a payment account (faster payments is a popular payment method in the uk)
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq13.png" class="screenshot">
                <p>
                    Backup Bisq, this should be done regularly
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq14.png" class="screenshot">
                <li><h3>Making a trade</h3></li>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq15.png" class="screenshot">
                <p>
                    You are now ready to make a trade, you can either take an existing offer or create a new offer, the maker
                    fees are 0.1% and the taker fees are 0.7%. When creating an offer you can set a percentage to deviate from
                    the current market price, so it often pays to be patient and create your own offer.
                </p>
                <img src="images/bisq/bisq16.png" class="screenshot">

                <p>
                    As you can see from the images above you need to "Fund your offer", this is to pay for the trading fee and
                    the security deposit (more on this later). This is awkward as you need bitcoin to be able to buy bitcoin,
                    you could buy some bitcoin off a friend or use a
                    <a href="https://coinatmradar.com" target=_blank>bitcoin atm</a>.

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                During a trade both partys have to pay a security deposit, all trade funds (deposits, trade ammount and fees)
                are sent to a 2 of 2 multisig escrow with each party holding one of the keys, this means in order to move
                bitcoin from this multisig both partys need to sign the transaction i.e both partys need to agree on the payout
                of the trade. A signed transaction which sends all funds in the multisig to the Bisq donation address is signed 
                which can only be published after 20 days for fiat trades.
            </p>
            <img src="images/bisq/bisq18.png" width="700" style="position:relative; left:65px;"/>
            <p>
                If a trade isn't going as it should you can message your counterparty and if things don't get resolved before
                the end of the trade period (1 day for Faster Payments) a mediator will suggest a payout, and if things still
                aren't resolved you can publish the timelocked transaction and go to arbitration. More on dispute resolution
                can be found <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Dispute_resolution" target=_blank>here</a>.
