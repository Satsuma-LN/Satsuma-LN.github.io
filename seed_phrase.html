            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Also known as a mnemonic or mnemonic code, if you have ever used a bitcoin wallet you will likely have come across a seed phrase
                when setting up or backing up your wallet, you will have been asked to write down 12 or 24 seemingly random words. It is 
                essential that you <strong>back it up offline</strong> (either on paper or in steel) and <strong>keep it private</strong>, anyone 
                who knows your seed can spend your bitcoin. This is a unique property of bitcoin, knowing <i>is</i> owning, or put more poetically 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1366380292991311878?s=20" target="_blank">the map is the territory</a>.

                For most people, this is all you need to know. This post will go into some of the details behind hierarchical deterministic
                wallets (often referred to as hd wallets).

            <h2>Mnemonic Code and Seed generation</h2>
            <p>
                For the case of a 24 word mnemonic, 256 bits of entropy are generated by either your computer, a hardware wallet or 
                <a href="generating_seedphrase.html" target="_blank">manually</a> (by dice or other means) i.e. a number between 1 and 
                2<sup>256</sup> &#8776; 10<sup>77</sup> is chosen at random, for reference it is 
                <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/" target="_blank">estimated</a> that there are between 
                10<sup>78</sup> and 10<sup>82</sup> atoms in the observable universe. By the processes displayed below this entropy is used to 
                generate everyone of your bitcoin key pairs i.e. anyone with access to it can spend your bitcoin, for this reason it is very 
                important that this entropy is generated privately and that it truly is random - something which can be hard to prove.

                In the following diagrams a <span style="color: red;">red arrow</span> represents a process which cannot be reversed other than 
                by means of brute force, a <span style="color: blue;">blue arrow</span> represents a process which can be reversed. Data in a 
                <span style="color: green;">green box</span> should be kept private as it may give someone the ability to spend coins (note:
                other data should also be kept private due to privacy implications).
